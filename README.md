# Netflix Content Analysis: A Matplotlib Data Visualization Project

Welcome to the **Netflix Content Analysis** project! This Jupyter Notebook offers a hands-on exploration of the Netflix titles dataset, leveraging `pandas` for data manipulation and `Matplotlib` for creating insightful visualizations. Dive into the world of Netflix content to uncover trends in movies and TV shows, analyze content ratings, and visualize release patterns over the years.

## 📘 What You'll Learn

🔍 **Data Loading & Initial Inspection**
* Loading a CSV dataset into a `pandas` DataFrame.
* Basic inspection of the dataset structure and columns (`.head()`).

🧹 **Data Cleaning**
* Handling missing values by dropping rows with `NaN` in key columns (`type`, `release_year`, `rating`, `country`, `duration`, `show_id`).
* Verifying data integrity post-cleaning (`.count()`).

📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization**
* **Content Type Distribution**: Visualizing the count of Movies versus TV Shows using bar charts to understand the platform's content balance.
* **Content Ratings Overview**: Analyzing the distribution of various content ratings (e.g., TV-MA, TV-14, R) to identify prevalent audience demographics.
* **Temporal Trends**: Plotting the number of Movies and TV Shows released each year to observe historical content growth on Netflix.
* **Country-wise Content Contribution**: Identifying the top countries producing content for Netflix through visualizations.
* **Genre Analysis**: Exploring popular genres and categories (`listed_in`) on the platform.

🎨 **Matplotlib Customization**
* Applying various `Matplotlib` plotting functions: `plt.bar()`, `plt.plot()`.
* Customizing plot aesthetics with `xlabel()`, `ylabel()`, `title()`, `legend()`, `ylim()`, and `tight_layout()`.
* Saving plots to image files (PNG) for easy sharing and presentation.
